### **Building a P2P Message/Files Sharing App in Go — Detailed Roadmap**



---

## **Step 1: Define Core Requirements**

✅ **Peer Discovery** — Locate peers dynamically without a central server.
✅ **Messaging System** — Enable text message exchange between peers.
✅ **File Sharing** — Support efficient file transfer with progress tracking.
✅ **Cross-Platform Support** — Target Windows, Linux, and Android.
✅ **Terminal Interface Support** — Command-line functionality for Windows and Linux.
✅ **Encryption & Security** — Ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
✅ **Resilient Network Architecture** — Handle unstable connections gracefully.

---

## **Step 2: Choose Key Technologies**

### **Core Libraries/Tools**

✅ **libp2p** — For P2P networking, DHT-based peer discovery, and NAT traversal.
✅ **go-libp2p-kad-dht** — For decentralized peer discovery.
✅ **go-quic** — For fast, encrypted file transfer with UDP support.
✅ **cobra** — For building a clean command-line interface (CLI).
✅ **protobuf/Cap’n Proto** — For efficient binary data serialization.

## **Step 3: Design the Architecture**

### **Core Components**

1. **Node Management**
   * Each peer acts as a node with a unique ID (public key-based).
   * Nodes maintain routing tables for peer lookup.
2. **Peer Discovery**
   * Use **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** for decentralized discovery.
   * Nodes find each other by querying the DHT network.
3. **Messaging System**
   * Implement a simple pub/sub (publish-subscribe) model for message delivery.
   * Ensure messages are encrypted with **Noise Protocol** or **TLS**.
4. **File Sharing**
   * Use **libp2p Streams** for efficient data transfer.
   * Add chunking logic for large files to support pause/resume.
5. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
   * Commands like:
     * `send <file>`
     * `msg <peer_id> "Hello World"`
     * `list-peers`

## **Step 4: Data Flow Design**

1. **Peer Joins Network:**
   * Node connects to a bootstrap node.
   * Node announces itself to the DHT network.
2. **Peer Discovery:**
   * Nodes query the DHT to find other peers.
3. **Messaging Flow:**
   * Sender encrypts and signs the message.
   * Data is serialized and sent via libp2p streams.
4. **File Sharing Flow:**
   * File is split into chunks.
   * Each chunk is sent over encrypted libp2p streams.
   * Receiver reassembles the file.

## **Step 5: Development Plan**

### **Phase 1: Core Networking**

✅ Set up libp2p nodes.
✅ Implement DHT for peer discovery.
✅ Develop CLI to list peers.

### **Phase 2: Messaging System**

✅ Build message encoding/decoding using Protobuf or Cap’n Proto.
✅ Implement secure end-to-end encrypted messaging.

### **Phase 3: File Sharing**

✅ Develop file chunking logic for large files.
✅ Add pause/resume support with error recovery.

### **Phase 4: Cross-Platform Support**

✅ Use `go mobile` to build an Android version.
✅ Package the app for Windows and Linux using `xgo` or `nuitka`.

## **Step 6: Deployment & Testing**

✅ Use `nmap` and `tcpdump` to monitor network activity.
✅ Test on multiple devices in real-world conditions.
✅ Implement automated unit tests for core logic.
